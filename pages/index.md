## About
My name is Severin FÃ¼rbringer and this is my central online presence.  It
serves as an aggregator of my projects, posts, and thoughts.

I'm a programmer by profession. I apprenticed at BlueMouse GmbH in Baden,
Switzerland as a Web Developer where I maintained websites according to
customer requirements and was involved in the development of new web
applications.  

### Now

I'm currently an undergraduate student in computer science at the School of
Engineering, Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). Through studying
computer science I hope to broaden my horizons beyond web development. You
might occasionaly find me helping out with things over at the ol' company where
I apprenticed.
