My name is Severin Fürbringer and this is my central online presence.  It
serves as an aggregator of my projects, posts, and thoughts.

I'm a programmer by profession. I apprenticed at <a
href="https://www.bluemouse.ch/" target="_blank">BlueMouse GmbH</a> in Baden,
Switzerland as a Web Developer where I maintained websites according to
customer requirements and was involved in the development of new web
applications.

<div class="two-thirds column">
I'm currently an undergraduate student in computer science at the School of
Engineering, <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/"
target="_blank">Zurich University of Applied Sciences</a> (ZHAW). Through
studying computer science I hope to broaden my horizons beyond web development.
You might occasionaly find me helping out with things over at the ol' company
where I apprenticed.
