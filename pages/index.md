# Hello

<div class="row">
<div class="two-thirds column">
My name is Severin FÃ¼rbringer and this is my central online presence.  It
serves as an aggregator of my projects, posts, and thoughts.

I'm a programmer by profession, though currently back in school preparing for a
degree in computer science.  I enjoy using unix-like operating systems and
configuring them to best suit my needs. The declarative and functional
operating system [NixOS](https://nixos.org) is what powers most of my computers
and makes reproducible deployments very straightforward.
