# Hello

My name is Severin FÃ¼rbringer and this is my central online presence.  It
serves as an aggregator of my projects, thoughts and links to other online
profiles.

I'm a programmer by profession, though currently back in school preparing for a
degree in computer science.  I enjoy using unix-based operating systems aswell
as configuring them to best suit my needs. The declarative nature of
[NixOS](https://nixos.org) has been most enjoyable out of all of my experiences
with GNU/Linux-based operating systems. Thus it's what I use nowdays.

You can learn more about my computing environment here (TODO).
