h2 Posts and memos
p I sometimes write small and technical memos. They serve a documentative purpose for myself on interesting topics I happen to be occupied with at the time.
for post, slug in public.post._data
  h3.post-list-heading: a(href="/post/#{slug}")= post.title
  .post-subtext Posted on 
    span= post.date 
    | &nbsp;
    //span.post-category= post.category
    for cat in post.category
      span.post-category= cat
  .post-description= post.description
